# Data-Mining

The main purpose of writing this document is to sort out and summarize some of the knowledge and ideas gained in the process of learning data mining and related fields. While combing the articles and algorithms that some of them are more interested in, they are also establishing a memorandum so that they can query more quickly when needed in the future. Finally, it is also the hope of communicate my shallow and vulgar views with more good people in order to get more criticism and correction.
